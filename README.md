# Calculator
A command line based calculator.  
Simple: get input as an expression, print the result the next line.  
Not so when you realize that an expression cannot be processed like number->operation->new number->operation...,
multiplication and division should be handled before addition and subtraction. And what about exponentiation? What about parentheses?
